Android Repo for Submitting Assignments

My Plan for this Semester is to create a Mobile Health App In Native Android using Android Studio And either Kotlin or Java. 
This app is to assist healthcare professionals especially within a designated local community remotely access patient’s clinical information in order to perform diagnoses and treatment of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and others. 
For now that is core of the app but I intend to use the incremental approach to Software development, hence I would be added some features during the development life cycle of the application. 

I have created a new branche called "Assigments" and I have uploaded all my snapshots at that branch. 

I have created another branche called "Final_Project" which contains all the source code for my Final project. 
Thank you
